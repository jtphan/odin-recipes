    <h2>This is a tasty hamburger.</h2>

    <p>A hamburger is probably one of the most iconic foods in American culture. 
        It consists of a nice hearty bun, a hefty beefy patty, and a assortment of vegetables and condiments.
        In my most recent explorations of hamburger varieties, I have seen them with thick, juicy patties, or even
        as a "smash" burger. Burgers come in all shapes and sizes. </p>
